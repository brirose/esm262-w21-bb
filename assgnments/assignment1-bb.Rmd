## Why I am taking 262

I am taking 262 because I am interested in honing my computational skills and workflow. I am new enough to data science that it is helpful to have directed excercises that help me to determine what to practice.


## My data science background

In terms of my background, I have been programming in R for a few years now, mostly as a biologist/ecologist. In undergrad, I took a course in Computational Biology that outlined basic data science principles and practices and gave a survey of computational analyses useful in biology and ecology. I also have a background in GIS, primaily using Arc, but also in R. Here at Bren I took 206 and am currently enrolled in 244. I would consider myself very much a learner.
