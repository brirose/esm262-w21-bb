## Instructions 

Write a function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items

* the most common fish, 

* the rarest fish

* the total number of fish

AND

 include an option (defaulted to FALSE) that if TRUE also returns a histogram of the number of each fish type, with a title giving the total number of fish caught.  Remember that you can save a graph as a variable.
 
```{r}
fish <- read_tsv(here("assignments", "Assignment 4", "data", "fish.txt"))
  
```
